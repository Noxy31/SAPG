# THIS IS A GUIDE FOR DEVELOPING MOBILE APP WITH KIVY/KIVYMD IN PYTHON #

This project is actually still under development. Files countain the code for a basic app, you can use it as a template for your own app. It was supposed to be a guide for a mobile game called Stella Arcana so don't pay attention to the RPG references.

You will find the Python code in main.py and the kivy code in App.kv

To turn your app into .apk and deploy it on Android I encourage you to watch the tutorial of Python Simplified channel right here ( for Windows and Linux ) : https://youtu.be/VsTaM057rdc
